# The Flanking Mechanic
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

Essentially, when a unit is hit, the direction of the hit becomes the frontal flank of the
 unit, where it'll receive 100% damage. If it's then hit from the back, it'll receive 200% damage.

## Flanking Indicators

- BAR has a toggle setting that will display the flanking information on a unit after it receives damage.

### Forward Indicator
- When a unit is hit for the first time in a bit, it recieves a 'Forward' direction, indicated by a pointer towards the attacker.
- This indicates the Frontal direction the unit, where it will receive 100% damage.

### Back Indicator
- There is also a 'Back' direction indicator, represented by this red partial circle.
- This indicates the back flank direction, where the unit will receive 200% damage.

### Hit From the Side
- When a unit is hit from the side, the flanking damage modifier depepends on the angle. If hit from 90Â° from the frontal flank, it'll receive 150% damage.

## How it Works
- When a unit gets hit, it receives a flank direction if it doesn't already have one, towards the direction of the hit.
- Each hit after the first recieves bonus damage, depending on the angle of attack compared to the flank direction (200% if hit from directly behind).
- The flank direction then adjusts and moves towards the new hit - the amount it moves depends on how long it's been since the last hit.

### 3D Flanking Bonus
- The display for the flanking directions is represented in 2D, but the actual direction is 3 dimentional, so a unit's frontal flanking direction can be pointed towards the sky if that unit takes damage from above.

### What this Means for Gameplay

- Moving in ways that prevent your opponent from surrounding you is important
- Running around units can increase damage output and kill that unit quicker
- Hiting with a lesser unit in one direction before a big unit hits in a second will increase the damage of the big unit significantly
