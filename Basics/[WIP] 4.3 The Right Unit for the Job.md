## Team Games
- **Scout Units**: Extremely Cheap, light, very fast, and large LoS. Great at very very early game harass before too many other units are out and getting information.
  - Pawns, Grunts, Blitz Tanks, Incisors
- **Raiding Units**: Cheap, light, and fast units. Great at repositioning quickly to catch leaks, or leak themselves. Bad against LLT lines.
  - Pawns, Grunts, Blitz Tanks, Incisors
- **Skirmishing Units**: Units that engage at max range and distance.
  - Missile Trucks, Rocket Bots
- **Assault Units**: Tanky units that can take some damage while they engage. Benefit greatly from regular repairs.
  - Medium Tanks, Plasma Bots
- **Anti-Swarm Units**: Units with good Area of Effect damage and Impulse. Good against medium to large numbers of light units.
  - Janus, Centurion, Pounder
### Laning
- In team games, the laning phase of the game is mostly played using Skirmishing units, or Assault units.
  - In the case of Skirmishers, you want to engage at max range and minimize how much damage you're taking. In mirror matches, that can get a little tedious, moving forward and back while trading blows with enemy units.
  - To help skirmish, using something to establish Line of Sight helps significantly. That can be an aggressively placed Radar right behind your units, or a Scout (Rascal, Rover, Tick, Grunt) in the line with the the Rocket Bots.
  - Assault units you want to drive up, tank a bit of damage, kill higher value targets, and retreat to repair with Rez bots, Commander, or Both.

- Both unit classes are also susceptible to being swarmed and rushed. Players usually combat that by establishing a small LLT line that they can retreat to, positioning their Commander to support with Dguns, and adding in Anti-Swarm units with your assault units when you're still building up their numbers.

- Once LLT lines are drawn, Raiding Units don't have a lot of utility before you actually pierce a hole in the enemy's line with the other types of units. If you're anticipating a breach, you can switch to a flood of Grunts or Pawns to run through the gap and deal a lot of damage.
  - You want a few Raiders to help you get to mid quickly and secure your territory / protect your Cons, because the other units are much much slower, and harder to reposition and cover your expansion paths towards the mid point.
  - Try like 3 to 5 as a baseline for a narrow lane to cover, and scale up for maps that have wider fronts, going up to maybe 10 to 15 on something like Flats and Forests.
  - Scouts if you have them available also help act as spotters so that you can see what the enemy is producing and where they're sending them. Combined with Radars, you can maneuver your Raiding units to help secure your lane from leaks before your Commander can establish LLT lines.
