# Putting it All Together
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

### There are three checklists that can help you put some of this basic info together

<br>

## (1) The Constant Checklist

This checklist is a list of things to constantly monitor as the game moves on. If you ever find yourself unsure of what you should be doing, it should be going through this list. Doing so can help you remember what you should be doing.

- Build Nearby metal Extractors
- Balance your Energy and Buildpower
- Check the Minimap (or zoom out)
- Control Territory
-

## (2) Pre-Game Checklist

This checklist contains things you should think about before your commander is beamed down, when the game is loaded in, but not started yet. It comes in two parts, one to servey the map's terrain, and two, formulating an opener.

### A. Take a look at the map's features

1) **Check where the Metal is.**
	- Is there a lot of metal?
	- Are there bigger nodes than others?
	- Is a larger percent of metal in the middle of the map?
	  
2) **Is the distance to your opponent long or short?**
   
3) **Is the area you need to defend wide open or narrow?**
   
4) **Is there a lot of M or E reclaim? Metal in rocks/crystals?**
   
5) **What is the wind speed like? Tide?**

### B. Put together an Opener
