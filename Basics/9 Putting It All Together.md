# Putting it All Together
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

#### There are three checklists that can help you put some of this basic info together

<br>

## (1) The Constant Checklist

This checklist is a list of things to constantly monitor as the game moves on. If you ever find yourself unsure of what you should be doing, it should be going through this list. Doing so can help you remember what you should be doing.

- Build Nearby metal Extractors
- Balance your Energy and Buildpower
- Check the Minimap (or zoom out)
- Control Territory
-

## (2) Pre-Game Checklist

This checklist contains things you should think about before your commander is beamed down, when the game is loaded in, but not started yet. It comes in two parts, one to servey the map's terrain, and two, formulating an opener.

### __A. Take a look at the map's features__

1) **Check where the Metal is**
	- Is there a lot of metal?
	- Are there bigger nodes than others?
	- Is a larger percent of metal in the middle of the map?
	  
2) **Is the distance to your opponent long or short?**
   
3) **Is the area you need to defend wide open or narrow?**
   
4) **Is there a lot of Metal or Energy reclaim? Metal in rocks/crystals? Is it in more Contested Space?**
   
5) **What is the wind speed like? Tide?**

More Details about the terrain can be found here: [Understanding the Terrain](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/5%20Understanding%20the%20Terrain.md)

### B. Put Together an Opener

Your opener should always be based on the map features, where you spawn, and who/where your allies spawn

1) Openers should almost always include taking all metal very close to your spawn asap
2) As you claim the metal nodes near your commander, watch over your energy. If you plan to build a solar, you can let it deplete first, as solars do not cost energy. If you're planning to build wind, do it before your energy runs out, since they do cost energy
3) If there is reclaim to fight over in contested areas, or you plan to rely on Energy reclaim early, you may want a bot lab sooner than later to build a rez bot and some faster/cheaper units to defend them
4) Consider Your Base Layout - [Base Layout Guide](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/3%20Base%20Layout.md)

More Details about Openers can be found here: [Common Openers](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/1%20Common%20Openers.md)

#### Doing these things before the game even starts will help you avoid making a lot of common mistakes and help you develop a sense of good ways to play even if you are new to a map.

## (3) The Learning Priority Checklist

This checklist is meant to help with understanding where your focus should be as you learn the game. It is more or less a priority checklist. Try and get a strong grasp of each of these principles before moving onto the next.

1) **Understand the basic fundementals / mechanics**
	- Understanding the base mechanics of the game is crucial, for if you do not know which keys do what or how reclaim works, how can you play well?
	- Understand how to use the draw and drag mechanics, inserting things into your queue, repeat command, autogroups...ect.
	- Understand how resources drain and gain per second, and get a feel for how they drain building common units/structures.

2) **Work on your opener, adapt to the map and situational changes, every game is different**
	- Take a look at the [Pre-Game Checklist](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/9%20Putting%20It%20All%20Together.md#2-pre-game-checklist)

4) **Work on Controlling space and Expanding your Economy
	- Create long queued orders for builders to build metal extractors, energy production 
	- Send Commander forward and Constructors out to expand metal production
	- 

5) **Work on Unit Control, try to fight often without losing much**
