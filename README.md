## Basic Guide to Making Guides

#### The most important thing is to try to be concise.


### Guidelines

**If you're putting something together, it helps to formulate it how you think about it. It doesn't have to be perfect, we can edit it later.**
Personally, I think outlining it first and breaking it down into smaller bits after helps. It keeps me on track and I find it easier to 

#### For Finishing a Guides:
1) Try to explain the subject matter fully, while being as concise as possible while also speaking in a language anyone can understand
2) Starter guides should be as short as possible. The more advanced the guide, the more detailed it can be. If there is a technical guide on the subject, please reference it so the player has somewhere to look if they want a deeper explanation
3) For technical guides, try to explain the entire inner workings of the subject, including specific numbers and formulas *(I have a spreadsheet for eco stuff in the works that I wouldn't mind having others work on as well)*
4) Verify your information! I find myself opening a single player game up to test conditions just to be sure I'm not providing false information
5) Double verify - Ideally, we check each other's work and make sure it's correct
6) Try not to ramble, anecdotes can be fun and keep people interested, but shouldn't be super long
7) Each folder has a readme attached for more specific details for those guides


### Formatting / Workflow
- I usually fill in title/author and a general header/subheader outline first and add in details after to keep myself on track. If something gets overly detailed, I consider breaking those details off into a technical guide.

### Zeteo Notes:

- Many of these guides are blank, acting as a placeholder as to not forget, feel free to fill in any or add a guide you think is useful that isn't already covered
- The filled in guides are often unfinished / work in progress (WIP). Feel free to edit or add to any of these
- For now, most of what I've done is to just consolidate the information on appropriate pages. Some of that should probably be broken down into subpages, as some of it gets a bit long

## How Do?
- If you are unfamiliar with github or markdown, don't be afraid to ask questions!

#### Some Git Jargon
- **Repo** - Repository, the hub where everything is stored
- **Commits** - Essentially what git calls saving
- **PR** - Pull Request - Essentially asking to merge your file(s) with the main repo (must be approved by the repo owner)
- **Branch** - A place to make edits, has a more Convergent workflow
- **Fork** - Another place to make edits with a more divergent workflow in mind

Essentially, after creating an account, you either want to create a branch or a fork from the main repo, make your edits, then submit a PR.

*NOTE: Many tutorials out there has you get started with using/syncing the desktop app, this one is more for getting started using only the website.*

#### Using Markdown

- Github can be used with a variety of markings / code. Here, we're using markdown as it's very easy to use. So each file here ends in a .md
- Some markdown guides that I tend to reference:
