# The Economic Gameloop

### The Economic Gameloop is the general economic fundemental backbone
- This should be focused on first before anything else, oftentimes other issues can stem from an improper economy

## The Loop:

### 1) Build up your metal income whenever possible by building mexes

  **Metal [M]** should almost always be your limiting factor for building, as such, grabbing metal extractors [mex] early is important, especially the mexes you start near
> - *(so always grab those asap while making sure you don't stall on energy)* <br>
> - *(This comes with the caveat that you need to have enough units to defend and make sure you have enough Energy to pump that metal out of the ground)*

### 2) Add on **Energy [E]** as you build more mexes so that you have energy to spend that metal, and so you never run out
- Running out of E is bad because it not only slows down production, but also turns off critical infrastructure. Mexes and many laser weapons require energy to function
    *(Ideally not over spending either, but I wouldn't worry about that too much right now)*

### 3) If your metal starts going up and you have sufficient energy, add on small bits of **Build Power [bp]** to assist your lab
   *(At first this should be your commander alternating between assisting the lab and building E when E runs out in order to work up a few constructors to help grab mexes, build energy and assist the lab. While making those constructors, you may want some fighting units too, so the timing will vary)*
   *(After enough constructors to do that, or if your metal is starting to running out is a good time to move the commander forward - this will differ depending on how many units you build with your constructors and how important controlling the space between you and your opponent is [what stuff is there in the middle to fight for, and how important is it?]*

#### *(This can be accelerated or decelerated depending on how aggressive you wish to be on w/e map - this isn't entirely specific to your replay / this map)*
